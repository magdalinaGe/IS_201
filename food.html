    <p>
        <spna class="bold">Khinkali</spna> (Georgian: ხინკალი) is a very popular Georgian dumpling made of twisted knobs of dough, 
        stuffed with meat and spices. It is considered to be one of the national dishes of Georgia.
        
        Different regions of Georgia make khinkali with different fillings. The most popular filling is a pork/beef mix. 
        
        In the mountains, khinkali is often made with a lamb filling. Fillings can also include Imeretian cheese mixed with 
        cottage cheese; mushrooms; and mashed potato.
         City versions include kalakuri khinkali (with thinly chopped parsley) and khevsuruli khinkali (without parsley).</p>
         <h2>Etiquette</h2>
         <p>Khinkali is eaten plain or with ground black pepper. The meat filling is uncooked when khinkali is assembled, so when it is cooked, 
            the juices of the meat are trapped inside the dumpling.
             To make khinkali juicier, usually warm water or broth is added to the minced meat. Khinkali is typically consumed first by sacking t
        he juices while taking the first bite, similar to xiaolongbao, in order to prevent the dumpling from bursting. The top, where the pleats meet, is tough, and is not supposed to be eaten, but discarded to the plate so that those eating can count how many they have consumed. In Georgia, this top is called the kudi (Georgian: კუდი, "tail") or k'uch'i (Georgian: კუჭი, "stomach").

            There is a widespread etiquette in Georgia to use only one's bare hands while consuming these dumplings. 
            The using of utensils, like a fork, is considered incorrect or childish. This is because juice is an important part of khinkali;
             using a fork will rupture the khinkali and the juice will be spilled.</p>
